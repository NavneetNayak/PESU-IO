# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Test to see which machine learning model that is able to accurately classify news as real or fake for out PESU I/O final project. Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

1. Cleaned the data using modules like nltk
2. Used processes like stemming, removing punctuation, stopwords etc...
3. Fit the data into many different types of models like Logistic Regression, K-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVC, Random Forest Classifier.

Found SVC to be giving the best results at 99.48% accuracy on the test data.
