# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

We built a machine learning model that is able to accurately classify news as real or fake for out PESU I/O final project. We used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

We cleaned the data using modules like nltk, and used processes like stemming, removing punctuation, stopwords etc...

We fit the data into many different types of ML models like Logistic Regression, K-NN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVC, Random Forest Classifier. And found SVC to be giving the best results at 99.48% accuracy on the test data.
